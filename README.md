# BasicPropertySearch

On this project mainly focused on Web API security using access token(JWT)
I could't complete everything in given time. I spent most of my time on design and security.

ToDo list:
- Implement unit test for web api
- Save search by loged user
- Retrive search
- Record anonymous user searchs
